- Live Site URL: [Live-Site](https://intro-section-dropdown1.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React 
- css grid
- flexBox

### What I learned

I learned how to change the hero image source depending on the device width. Also I have never done a collapsable side bar from scratch, which was really neat. This project helped me understand the css functions clamp and calc a bit better, which I will use more in the future. 

### Continued development

I want to learn more on how to use and change svgs in the layout as well as use more transitions on collapsable elements.
